Selected Army airborne forces provide a large portion of the GRF, and are dependent on joint concepts for deployment and access. This study illustrates a method for determining the best access strategies given constraints in aircraft, intermediate staging bases, operational capabilities, and other factors. The study applies this method to each geographic combatant command and develops specific, tailored strategies for each. 

The access strategies are built from multiple analytic techniques: historical aircraft data and platform specifications to determine capabilities and limitations of the air fleet; several airfield databases, site reports, and expert judgments to determine probable intermediate staging base locations and their likely capabilities; multiple deployment concepts for access to minimize operational risks; and, detailed geographic and operational analysis to determine global coverage and reach. In the end, we were able to deduce a preferred strategy for each of the combatant commands.  

Global access for the GRF is provided partially through the use of well-established staging bases, but will necessarily rely on austere basing and complex deployment concepts for particular locations in multiple combatant commands.  The study concludes with recommendations to close those risks, which span the services, combatant commands, and joint staff.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,False

Every rule of politics is coming into question as technology disrupts the ways we receive and come to be convinced of information.  Even fundamental ideas in the social sciences such as the Median Voter Theorem of game theory, do not seem to apply anymore.  Nexus Schema Learner, an OSD/TRAC agent based simulation (Duong et al 2007), has been demonstrated to represent the development of a polarization in society (Wilcox,2012), which is an important factor in both demagoguery and irregular warfare.    The Nexus Schema Learner simulates agent cognition with a Boltzmann Machine Neural Network in every agent, the same technology in Googles deep learning algorithm that plays Go. Nexus Schema Learner has been used with a game tree to simulate the moves and countermoves of irregular warfare in a Battle-of-Algiers-like scenario. (Duong and Pearman 2013).  Nexus Schema Learner is a reinforcement learning AI program that plays an Irregular Warfare wargame, instead of Go, but plays it using social science theories such as Cognitive Dissonance theory.  To simulate demagoguery, we present a simulation of Allen's _The Nazi Seizure of Power_, using an agent based simulation with a Boltzmann machine similar to Nexus Schema Learner, and then modernize the scenario by adding today's communication technology and measuring its effect.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,False

Many factors can come into play in effective contingency basing decision. The physical and sociocultural environments impact CBs and, in turn, CBs affect those environments. Failure to understand these effects may result in increased logistical burdens and unintended consequences on mission effectiveness or the local population and natural resources. Spatial decision support tools can aid in this process by screening locations in terms of greater or lesser anticipated suitability. Here we present ongoing progress with the new CB-SITE project, led by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC).  We introduce our methods for developing a set of criteria, metrics, design choices, and constraints to support tool-based CB site screening, based on interviews with experienced personnel and analysis of doctrine and guidance.  We also share our results and progress to date.

The MLAC cost team determined the key cost drivers that made each alternative capable of engaging a surface maritime target from a mobile land-based launcher. This presentation will provide background, methodology, and resulting cost and technology matrix.

To identify the cost implications of an Army MLAC, the study team created a cost matrix to compare different alternatives across a given cost element. Initially there were no requirements or set alternatives; therefore, the study team determined which cost appropriation categories were pertinent to the study, relying on previous missile studies (e.g., LRPF AoA, JAGM AoA Update #2) to develop cost drivers within each appropriation category for MLAC. The study team defined each cost driver and used the data to draft a cost matrix, which was submitted to the MLAC working group for evaluation. At the conclusion of the study effort, the team documented cost implications of technology changes to the alternatives and areas of concern identified by decision makers, for the purpose of identifying gaps and adjusting potential guidance requirements in the future.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,True

DHS is still developing its capacity to conduct sophisticated modeling and quantitative analyses, and to manage the ever-increasing amount of data required to execute DHS missions. 
The DHS University Centers of Excellence (COEs) are competitively selected university consortia aligned with major DHS missions. The COEs help DHS S&T meet the Congressional charge to maintain US leadership in S&T. Major U.S. universities compete to become long-term (10 year) partners in DHS research, development, education and training. 
One of the COEs contributions has been to develop quantitative analyses, models, and simulations. The COEs also help to create the workforce that can use these tools, so they also provide educational curricula and training support. Over 70% of COE-supported fellows have secured jobs in the homeland security community. Training is essential, since HR rules constrain DHSs ability to hire qualified analysts.

DHSs relationships with universities are different than most  more aggressive, less patient. We are trying to build universities into the fabric of DHS. To do this, we recently have instituted 10-year periods of performance, with do-or-die reviews every two years. Our message is: work closely with us, produce high quality science, and learn how to transition it, or be replaced after the biennial review.

As a result, the preferences of a representative group is assessed.   But the preferences of this group will differ from the preferences of the large population because of variation in the experiences and dispositions of individuals.  This raises two issues:

(1)	Preference assessments aimed at addressing different questions may have already been conducted with different groups from this same population.  Empirical Bayes (and hierarchical Bayes) methods can leverage this information to supplement the preference assessments currently been conducted.

Our approach, UCT-LO Comparison Enabling Reacquisition (ULCER), focuses on orbital parameters and timing components in order to account for up to four undetected maneuvers resulting in a rapid orbital transfer.

Current results take months to years to assess the full force structure and strategy solution space. In some cases, only part of the solution space can being analyzed.
A new kind of capability, termed a military enterprise model, might triage the solution space and provide hypotheses to the analyst that can be tested through focused analysis.

The complexity of joint operations, the range of conditions in which the force must operate, and the adaptiveness of adversaries challenge current analytical tools to evaluate force structure and strategies. Current results take months to years to assess the full force structure and strategy solution space. In some cases, only part of the solution space can being analyzed.
A new kind of capability, termed a military enterprise model, might triage the solution space and provide hypotheses to the analyst that can be tested through focused analysis. This will reduce the timeframe for analyzing the solution space from months to weeks. AF/A9 has analyzed the theoretical underpinnings of this type of capability, and determined that Bayesian networks may provide an approach for the model. A development approach for this capability and a methodology to guide the analyst is needed.
An enterprise model represents a new disruptive analytic capability, and like any new disruptive capability, design and development BEAM involves overcoming technical challenges and managing technical risks. The JHU/APL approach was built on prior AF/A9 BEAM efforts to ensure risks and challenges were identified and resolved.

The Marine Corps capstone operating concept, Expeditionary Force 21, recognizes these trends and, employing methods to composite discrete, forward-deployed forces in response to crisis, proposes the next step in tactical devolution. The proposal:  independent operations  supported with 21st century combined arms - by units at the company level and below. 

This presentation will illustrate that devolution towards companies can only occur if units possess the increased lethality, maneuverability, and sustainability to operate and survive against their most likely threats.

However, acquisition resources fund the development of individual systems, not the aggregate systems of systems (SoS) of which they are a part. Assessments of SoS interoperability in air warfare, surface warfare, amphibious warfare, and other operational contexts have demonstrated that interoperability deficiencies impede the full realization of system capabilities. This paper gives examples of such interoperability assessment efforts conducted by multiple organizations over the course of the past three decades and of how assessment findings led to correction of interoperability issues that impeded system capabilities. Follow-through of assessment findings included repeated documentation of the issues to system program offices and/or the Joint Interface Configuration Control Board to spur correction of those issues. In some cases, specific programs corrected software deficiencies; in other cases, enterprise solutions were developed that were implemented by multiple system programs.

A problem framed without adequate consideration of civil factors - including key groups influences, motivations, objectives, and capabilities as well as local governance, infrastructure, instability drivers and resiliencies - is an insufficiently understood problem.
This is a critical issue since problem framing informs the military operations that are expected to create a platform for stability. Current practice, engendered by a lack of understanding of stability operations and/or discomfort with the ambiguous nature of the human domain, is to relegate consideration of civil factors to later phases of the fight. Recent history demonstrates that this results in unnecessary risk to the mission, if not mission failure.
This presentation asks the question, What does it mean to set conditions for stability in environments that are far from stable?  The methodology presented builds on lessons learned and emphasizes analysis of socio-cultural, political and economic factors and their relevance to operations.

Suite 401,,Arlington,VA,22202,United States,,,16515,True,"Testing a system frequently involves repeated independent identical tests with a pass/fail decision the result of testing. The number of tests to be done typically is fixed in advance of the start of testing. This is a flawed test methodology. Test conduct should depend on the outcome of testing to date. If one is confident of the outcome (pass or fail), one should be prepared to quit early. If the outcome is ambiguous, then and only then should testing continue. The testing approach discussed here adopts a Bayesian formalism and fixes, not the number of tests, but the expected number of tests to be done. In the limit that one expects to do several tens of tests, the optimal stopping strategy to minimize probability of pass/fail decision error is well modeled using a diffusive stochastic process. The stopping strategy in this limiting situation is simply expressed as a dimensionless positive real valued function of a single dimensionless positive real variable.
Doing enough sequences of tests that expected numbers of tests become numbers of tests, an improvement in testing strategy can be wrought. For fixed number of tests, probability of decision error is decreased. Fixing probability of decision error, the number of tests required is decreased. The decreases can be dramatic. Though the diffusive strategy function is a limiting case approximation, a Monte Carlo simulation shows how effective the scheme can be. This approach is effective in many testing situations.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,True

It involves a large number of decision makers selecting high-value strategic options under uncertainty with significant resource implications and long-term consequences. Strategic decision-making in todays defence and security environment is more complex than ever due to unpredictable conflicts, unfamiliar operational circumstances, and undeniable constraints of sociopolitical, environmental and economic factors. As a result, strategic decisions have been made on the basis of intuition, judgment and experience under a great deal of assumptions. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) has been widely employed in support of complex decision-making for a number of years. It assists in the structuring of problems in order to develop a common understanding, balance various requirements and identify an appropriate course of action. However, applying a generic MCDA method for strategic defence and security decisions can be a challenge. This is because the generic method has not been formalised into an approach applicable for defence and security context. This paper proposes a structured approach to adapt a generic MDCA method for supporting decision-making at the strategic level.

Selected Army airborne forces provide a large portion of the GRF, and are dependent on joint concepts for deployment and access. This study illustrates a method for determining the best access strategies given constraints in aircraft, intermediate staging bases, operational capabilities, and other factors. The study applies this method to each geographic combatant command and develops specific, tailored strategies for each. 

The access strategies are built from multiple analytic techniques: historical aircraft data and platform specifications to determine capabilities and limitations of the air fleet; several airfield databases, site reports, and expert judgments to determine probable intermediate staging base locations and their likely capabilities; multiple deployment concepts for access to minimize operational risks; and, detailed geographic and operational analysis to determine global coverage and reach. In the end, we were able to deduce a preferred strategy for each of the combatant commands.  

Global access for the GRF is provided partially through the use of well-established staging bases, but will necessarily rely on austere basing and complex deployment concepts for particular locations in multiple combatant commands.

Generally speaking, probability assessments describe the chances that a statement is true, and confidence levels describe a judgments analytic quality. Yet while probability is a well-defined concept, many analysts struggle to explain what confidence entails. We thus unpack confidence into three distinct concepts: reliability of available evidence, range of reasonable opinion, and responsiveness to new information. We explain how these ideas have different implications for decision making in principle, and we present original survey experiments showing that analysts and decision makers can consistently distinguish these concepts in practice. We focus primarily on intelligence analysis and national security, as this is a domain where debates about defining estimative language shape a large volume of analyses. But distinguishing probability and confidence is important in all areas of high-stakes decision making, and we connect our discussion of national security to related concerns about assessing uncertainty in fields such as law, climate change, and medicine.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,False

A key feature of the method is that it does not impose a simple model of actors' utility functions, such as the spatial model of politics. Their utility functions can even be determined by recursive application of the methodology to a nested subgame.

This new research describes the nature and extent of such error propagation and develops a procedure to estimate aggregate model uncertainty based on standard indices of consistency and underlying model structures (i.e., the number of entities and their hierarchical relationships).  The newly developed procedure provides interval estimates for parameter tolerances in any specific HDM application (as verified by extensive Monte Carlo simulation testing).  The presentation details application to one of the most common techniques for processing pairwise comparison data, the eigenvector ranking method, and describes generally-applicable guidelines for other prioritization techniques.

Our model explains 42.9% of the variation in schedule duration across the historical data from a sample of 56 defense programs from all military services. Statistically significant predictor variables include whether a program is a new effort or modification to an existing program, the year of Milestone B start as it relates to changes in defense acquisition reform policy, and the amount of raw funding (adjusted for inflation) prior to Milestone B for a program.

To minimize the risk of underestimating or overestimating a programs schedule, an unbiased method of schedule estimation is necessary. Through the application of multivariate regression, we create a model which predicts schedule duration from Program Initiation (Milestone B) to the Initial Operational Capability of the programs deliverable system. Our model explains 42.9% of the variation in schedule duration across the historical data from a sample of 56 defense programs from all military services. Statistically significant predictor variables include whether a program is a new effort or modification to an existing program, the year of Milestone B start as it relates to changes in defense acquisition reform policy, and the amount of raw funding (adjusted for inflation) prior to Milestone B for a program.

The purpose of this presentation is to provide an overview of some of the most prominent Bayesian data analysis tools (STAN, JAGS, and PyMC) and include examples of their use. In particular, this presentation will focus on how each of these tools allows analysts to develop Bayesian statistical models (such as Bayesian regression or hierarchical models), execute approximate inference using the various sampling methods available within each of the languages, conduct model diagnostics using graphical an non-graphical methods, and sample models and results from each of the languages. In addition, this presentation will provide practitioners several resources for getting started with Bayesian methods and going deeper into Bayesian statistics, data analysis methods, and machine learning. As this presentation will show, it has never been a better time to put some Bayesian tools in your analytical toolkit.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,True

The program couples simulation-based design with hands-on integration to provide an all inclusive approach to micro-grid education. Students learn the principles of power system sizing, power flow analysis, contingency analysis, and real-time dispatch using simulation-based design and training programs such as HOMER, PVSyst, XENDEE/EPRI OpenDSS, IncSys/PowerData PowerSimulator, PowerWorld, and open-source tools developed at ASU. Knowledge gained through simulation is then applied through hands-on training within ASUs micro-grid testbed. Topics include safety, integration, standards, testing, controls and operation, and maintenance.

The timelines associated with these courses of action can be expedited by exploiting existing internal hardware on most modern day satellites.  By exploiting in-phase and quadrature sampled data and ephemeris data from multiple orbiting resources, surfaces of equal phase and time can be derived and plotted on the polar coordinates of the Earths surface.

Optometry clinics provide both routine and acute care to Soldiers ensuring medical readiness and also treat Soldiers family members and retirees from the surrounding community. A discrete event simulation was used to examine six scheduling and staffing policies for the Womack Army Medical Centers Optometry Clinic with a goal of increasing the daily patient throughput of the clinic and staff utilization with consideration to patient waiting times. The best policy increased clinic throughput by eight patients a day, generating an additional $314,000 in Relative Value Units (RVUs) annually, while only increasing patient wait times by 26%. As a minimum, increasing the walk-in providers scheduled patient load by two enables the provider to optimally treat both scheduled and walk-in patients, with a $94,000 annual RVU increase.

The situation was further complicated by the fact that the formulation needed to be simultaneously optimized for multiple CWAs, under multiple processing conditions, on multiple types of surface materials, and in multiple physical orientations. 
ECBC leveraged the efficiency of designed experimentation by selecting a Mixture-Process DOE that included both mixture components and process factors.  Specialized statistical software was used to find a custom D-optimal Mixture-Process design that would meet the mixture constraints and allow a predictive model to fit terms for all linear blending, non-linear blending (mixture components) and first order, second order and interactions terms (process factors).

The use of MDS was created in response to attempts to quantify perceived likeness and difference between objects in behavioral and social sciences. Use of Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) techniques to estimate resemblance based on measurable characteristics can provide a cue to the possible membership in a group. 
Studies have shown that finding the changes and differences within a scene or image to detect important objects and areas of interest is a key skill for target detection. If the detection of anomalies can be seen as data points in the information that attributes to an individuals ability to detect key objects and areas, then it may be interesting to explore the performance of target detection through the use of anomaly detection related to targets and target cues.
Characteristics for this group of individuals may be determined experimentally.  The MDS methodology can be used to investigate the similarities that this group may have. The results can be used in the research stage and later implemented as a quality feedback method that to improve training and evaluation tool to highlight an individuals ability to find potential targets.

The USMC AAV fleet currently includes 1,052 end items with a total value of $3.7 billion.   Over the past 40 years, the USMC has maintained their AAV fleet using a variety of maintenance programs including depot level maintenance to refurbish, rebuild, and otherwise improve the AAV reliability, availability, and maintainability.  The AAV depot maintenance programs require large financial investments leading to questions of how long between maintenance events should AAVs wait before entering into the next program.   Studies have shown a reduction in Operational Availability (AO) as time elapses since last depot level rebuild or Inspect Repair Only As Necessary (IROAN).  The onus for maintenance then falls on the fleet field maintenance organizations.  The USMC Logistics Command Studies and Analysis Division has performed an analysis of the impact of of deferred depot level maintenance on the availability of AAVs within key USMC organizations.

Further, in a budget-constrained operating environment, the impact and amount of uncertainties increases, and thus, risk increases.  Accordingly, there must be greater focus on the narratives illuminating strategic and military risks which are key areas of the Comprehensive Joint Assessment (CJA), a JSPS Assess deliverable.  Thus, we propose an approach for providing functional component command and/or service major command level inputs to the CJA, that not only applies necessary focus on the topic of risk, but also achieves greater synchronization and integration across multiple JSPS deliverables such as: Theater Campaign Plan (TCP) Assessments, Theater Posture Plan (TPP) within the TCP, Integrated Priorities List (IPL), and Service Campaign Support Plan (CSP) Assessments.

An IQE is an equation that predicts the NIIRS scale for a sensor with a given set of sensor and environmental parameters. AMSAA is creating an algorithm that can predict the probability of acquisition for a system with a given NIIRS rating based on characteristics of the intended target such as the targets dimensions. Once a NIIRS scale, IQE, and an algorithm for determining the probability of acquisition as a function of a NIIRS value and target are developed, AMSAA will be able to estimate system level performance for lidar systems. This presentation will show our efforts in creating a series of algorithms that can calculate the probability of detect for lidar systems based on lidar sensor and environmental parameters along with the characteristics of the intended target.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,False

In response to this tasking, MEDCOM studied and implemented several changes to include reducing the number of Regional Health Command (RHC) organizations, restructuring MTFs based upon size, downsizing three MTFs by removing inpatient services, proposing a Health Executive Leadership Organization Structure (HELOS) in the Command Team at all MTFs, determining civilian end strength ceilings, and adjusting Table of Distribution and Allowances.  Each of these actions required an appropriate manpower study, which included determining requirements for Support to Staff ratio, identifying underutilized positions, restructuring for efficiency, and applying a model for HELOS based on the MTF category.  To facilitate this analysis, multiple operations research techniques were applied, with the analysis encompassing (for any given location) many aspects to include but not limited to the number of beneficiaries, the number of providers, and the productivity of a given MTF.  The result of this effort provided quantitative insights to help maximize Access to Care along with multiple other standards, including maintaining positive patient satisfaction while fully supporting the Armys mission.",UNCLASSIFIED WITH FOUO,Distribution Statement C,False

Combat simulations attempt to represent essential elements of warfare to support training, analysis, and testing. While combat simulations have rapidly incorporated representations of unmanned systems into their capabilities, little has been done to distinguish unmanned systems from human systems in these simulations. This is making it difficult to impossible to consider questions of future manned/unmanned system mix, levels of unmanned system autonomy required for most effective operational  success, and other relevant questions. One might think that replacing humans with fully autonomous unmanned systems, such as in unmanned convoys, results in identical mission performance with the added benefit of a decrease in loss of human life. However, this is a naïve line of reasoning when one considers that unmanned systems cannot react to the battlespace environment with the same level of flexibility as humans. Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to capture such distinctions in combat models. This presentation describes representations of manned and unmanned systems being investigated for the Combined Arms Analysis Tool for the 21st Century (COMBATXXI), a discrete-event simulation developed and employed by the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps to address analytical questions about future warfighting capabilities.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,False

However, easy to execute does not necessarily mean easy to analyze. Split-plot designs are a viable approach for tests with time constraints impacting execution or when operators helpfully group randomized runs by an important factor (range, distance, etc.). With the advent and incorporation of statistical software, tests are less difficult to design and evaluate, but there are risks when evaluating split-plots. This is a cautionary tale for analysts based on a communications system test using JMP 11. 
	The split-plot design is statistically complex in terms of analyzing whole plots, sub-plots, and easy to vary factors within each plot, but prior to using software analysts should understand how to calculate the appropriate number of plots and determine a reasonable combination of runs within each plot. When using JMP 11 users must be aware of how the software is treating the factors and analyzing data or analysts risk making serious errors that lead to different conclusions. Additional considerations include understanding the purpose of D-optimal and I-optimal designs, how model terms are evaluated, and how data is imported when using JMP 11.

Future test events can be planned where confidence in the parameter space is high or where data is sparse.  

AMULET was applied to an M&S environment. The results indicated an improvement in the measure of model validity and in the measure of parameter sensitivity. Iteratively applying AMULET when new test data was made available resulted in a filling of the parameter space of interest and a better representation of the parameter space in the M&S environment.

Future plans include analysis of measures of model validity and parameter sensitivity when AMULET is or is not applied to a given M&S environment. This may show how previous data collections could have been optimized by applying AMULET to more efficiently fill the parameter space while improving model confidence.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,True

The essential problem is that the important effects are not kinetic and are rarely directly observable, much less measurable.  Cultural diffusion, people knowing things without knowing how they know, people knowing things that aren't so, and  most important  not knowing what we don't know but need to know are all factors that make this problem difficult.  Adaptations of well-known methods such as triangulation, association among multiple data sources over time, searching for patterns that too closely match expected or usual data (and may therefore indicate spoofing or faking), and filtered anomaly detection (detect oddities, but filter out those that closely resemble previously investigated anomalies that turned out to be of no interest) are among the promising approaches.

The models elucidate requirements for combat support, vulnerabilities of different basing postures, sortie generation in a combat scenario, and cost optimized mitigation strategies. At the heart of resiliency modeling are algorithms that determine which assets will be attacked, and which will be destroyed, by enemy weapons. Collateral damage and the lethal effects radius of weapons against area targetsdefined here to be damage to assets resulting from a missile missing its primary target or damage to additional assets than only the one targetedare important, but were not previously accounted for in our models (and, generally speaking, are poorly represented in many air base resiliency modeling efforts). We describe a new methodology to incorporate the effects of collateral damage and lethal effects radii into our model that uses air base geospatial information. By more realistically representing battle damage, we now have a better picture of the full damage potential of an enemy both to U.S. operational effectiveness and to the safety of airmen.

Specifically, we seek to create models that generate aircraft-specific schedules for air tasking orders (ATOs) within an air operations center (AOC). An AOC provides command and control of all air and space assets tasked to a particular area of responsibility or strategic command. Scheduling these assets requires a high level of unified effort whereby centralized planning must be handled in a decentralized fashion. In addition, the difficulty of the process dictates that mission prioritization and aircraft/munitions allocation are separated in the cycle, sacrificing some global perspective for the sake of scheduling efficiency. We present a modeling framework that allows planners to simultaneously select missions and assign aircraft/munitions to the missions, allowing for the optimal air asset scheduling toward the pursuit of theater-level objectives. This flexible framework takes into account air refueling considerations as well as the need for certain missions to be completed by packages of particular aircraft types.

The power aperture form of the Radar Range Equation provides a way to assess the salient radar parameters given the requirement to search for a target of certain radar cross section at a desired range over a solid angle volume in a given amount of time. A required PAP was computed for a given search problem (search area, required acquisition, and threat). The required PAP was then compared to the PAP of the radar design to assess the TBM capability. The assessment varied a simple ballistic trajectory using different initial velocities and angles to represent different classes of TBMs. The study assessed the timeline to determine the firm track range and PAP needed to intercept at different altitudes for a given interceptor.

We provide an overview of the process used to statistically link fitness test items and performance on combat task simulations. The study team combined these statistical results with other metrics to create a prototype ten-item fitness test. To establish standards for the test, scales for each item were established. Current methods in literature for developing item scales are normative and not criterion based. Therefore, a new method was developed to explicitly tie each scale to combat performance, better meeting the intent of public law. This new method uses probit modeling to link points with the probability of combat task success. Using these scales, the optimal scoring system is found which includes a minimum component score and composite score. The pass/fail thresholds were chosen as those which maximized the Youden index.

We provide an overview of the process used to statistically link fitness test items and performance on combat task simulations. The study team combined these statistical results with other metrics to create a prototype ten-item fitness test. To establish standards for the test, scales for each item were established. Current methods in literature for developing item scales are normative and not criterion based. Therefore, a new method was developed to explicitly tie each scale to combat performance, better meeting the intent of public law. This new method uses probit modeling to link points with the probability of combat task success. Using these scales, the optimal scoring system is found which includes a minimum component score and composite score. The pass/fail thresholds were chosen as those which maximized the Youden index. This system ensures appropriate breadth and flexibility in an individuals fitness while maximizing classification accuracy. The prototype fitness tests were designed at the Operational level.

OptDef is a government rights tool that has been integrated and used with the DoD simulation models EADSIM, I-Sim, KIDD, G6, and C2BMC Planner, the commercial simulation tool ExtendSim, and most recently AFSIM.  When an analyst needs to explore the impact of varying multiple simulation inputs, the use of a tool to automate optimization and analysis saves significant time and resources and yields superior results.

To use OptDef with a simulation model an integration executable is required to perform three tasks for each run: update simulation inputs, execute the simulation, and retrieve simulation outputs.  This integration executable can be written in C#, Java, Python, Perl, or any other language.  For the recent AFSIM User Group Meeting we created a Python integration executable that enables an analyst to perform simulation optimization and analysis studies using OptDef and AFSIM.  This Python script was created in under a week and is less than 100 lines of code.  This same technique can be used to quickly wrap any simulation model to perform optimization and analysis studies.

In this talk well introduce OptDef, and then focus on how an integration executable is created.  We will use the recent AFSIM integration as an example to demonstrate the steps required to enable optimization and analysis with any simulation model.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,True

This presentation provides an over view of an open source software reliability tool developed in collaboration with the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR). The tool implements reliability models [1] to aid DoD organizations and their contractors to quantitatively measure and predict the reliability improvement of software. These tools will empower government officials by enabling greater oversight of software during the acquisition process, ensuring quality of the systems developed with taxpayer dollars. In addition to use as a standalone application, the open source nature of the project means that the code can be verified by information assurance specialists and integrated directly into the testing processes of an organization and those of the contractors they oversee.

This presentation provides an over view of an open source software reliability tool developed in collaboration with the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR). The tool implements reliability models [1] to aid DoD organizations and their contractors to quantitatively measure and predict the reliability improvement of software. These tools will empower government officials by enabling greater oversight of software during the acquisition process, ensuring quality of the systems developed with taxpayer dollars. In addition to use as a standalone application, the open source nature of the project means that the code can be verified by information assurance specialists and integrated directly into the testing processes of an organization and those of the contractors they oversee.

Complicating these fiscal challenges are the many systems that organizations have acquired, built, and customized over the past decade to meet mission needs. These systems often contain duplicative functionality and are very difficult to integrate because of their proprietary architectures. To cost-effectively maintain and modernize their capabilities, organizations must identify where to make intelligent cuts and consolidation, where to develop new capabilities to fill gaps, and how to integrate what is left in ways that improve mission performance.

To address these challenges, we developed the Attune open source enterprise tool to visualize our clients entire portfolio with full traceability across mission capabilities requirements, all the way to the system and services. Attune enables you to perform enterprise design activities and determine the missions specific, common, and core services needed to make intelligent trade-off analyses and open architecture design. Employed across several programs in the Navys Program Executive Office Command, Control, Communications, Computers & Intelligence (PEO C4I), Attune helped gain a clear picture of their enterprise portfolio to efficiently and effectively enable decision making around end-of-life management (PMW 160), system evolution (PMW 120), and system-of-systems platform modernization (PMW 790).",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,True

We investigate the association between fuel price shocks and Air Force flying operations via data on Air Force flight hours, aviation fuel costs, and cost per flight hour for each Major Command between the years 2000 and 2015. We find that crude oil prices have a large negative impact on flight hours across different types of flying and major commands. In particular, flying hours in training units, reserve units, and Air National Guard units appear to incur the deepest cuts with fuel price increases while combat-oriented commands, such as Air Combat Command are affected the least. This suggests that, when faced with price shocks, the Air Force shifts resources to focus on short term mission completion while potentially harming long term readiness. Furthermore, while most major commands have costs that run roughly proportional to increases in crude oil prices, the cost of flight hours under the Air Mobility Command Transportation Working Capital Fund appear to be very sensitive to even small changes in crude oil prices, with rate increases that are almost double the increases in costs for traditional Air Mobility Command flight hours.",UNCLASSIFIED WITH FOUO,Distribution Statement B,False

The Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) Support Agreement (4000.19) states that each Service should collect reimbursement for any services that can be directly attributed to the tenants residing on their installations. Army installations currently lack standard guidance on how to accurately measure services rendered and collect reimbursement from these non-Army tenants. The Army must improve its policies to ensure installations are fully and accurately being reimbursed for services provided to tenants. 
The Center for Army Analysis (CAA) conducted an analysis that defined the current state of non-Army tenants on installations. The analysis team examined existing DoDIs and Army regulations (ARs); collected reimbursement data from selected installations; and interviewed several installations Garrison Commanders, resource managers (RMs), and support agreement managers (SAMs) to determine best practices that would ensure accurate measurement and reimbursement from tenants to enable cost savings.

In general, overall squadron effectiveness will improve or degrade when resource levels or system are changed.
For the purpose of this presentation, a training system configuration is a unique combination of resources, requirements and constraints available to and placed upon the flight and maintenance systems at the squadron level.  Different training system configurations will feature different cost, risk and effectiveness relative to one another.  In some cases, one or more resource levels can be increased to offset a decrease in another resource level resulting in reduced cost and/or risk while maintaining acceptable overall effectiveness of the system.
In order to better understand these resource levels and interactions, a fly-day based, aircraft-level, stochastic simulation, called the Operational Model or Op Model, was written in MATLAB R2015a.  The purpose of the Op Model is to determine the effectiveness of different single-TMS training system configurations at meeting a daily flight hour production requirement.

Current budgetary constraints and an uncertain global security environment require these operations to be executed efficiently. Base camps are the secured areas where soldiers live when deployed to contingency operations. Base camps impose a significant financial and tactical burden during contingency operations and ineffective soldier quality of life decisions have contributed to costs. Quality of life (QOL) refers to the non-security and non-mission related services that directly sustain soldier mission effectiveness. Current US Army base camp tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are insufficient, and detailed doctrine should be developed to support combat units executing contingency operations. We employ quantitative methods to select decisions that improve QOL on base camps to inform doctrine. We use a QOL function and resource consumption data developed by US Army Natick Labs to build a model that improves QOL under the constraints of four resources: fuel, water, waste water, and solid waste. We employ a mixed integer linear program modeling approach and sensitivity analysis to evaluate the strength of our results.

This discussion will show how the helicopter routing problem can be modeled as a service network design problem with time windows. While this integer program is difficult to solve in a timely manner for any problem of realistic size, we propose two heuristic algorithms that allow the problem to be solved faster and on a larger scale.

The Fbar (F?) model, developed by the U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA), is a Monte Carlo simulation for estimating the effectiveness of small arms weapons and munitions.  Fbar simulates a single direct-fire weapon firing at a passive area personnel target.  In each replication, Fbar considers aiming strategy, delivery accuracy, and vulnerability data to estimate the probability of incapacitating each of the targets in the area, and therefore the fraction F of the target that is incapacitated.  The principal model output is F?, the average of F over all replications.

As originally developed, Fbar could handle bullets and fragmenting munitions.  Fragmenting munitions could have a point-detonating fuze or an air-bursting fuze triggered by elapsed time or turns count.  In late 2014, the Armys Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of an air-bursting munition with a proximity fuze. In response, AMSAA developed two algorithms that calculate where a proximity fuze will function as the munition comes near to the ground, a target, or a protective wall.  AMSAA ran both algorithms for millions of conditions.  They agree to within 1/800th of a centimeter.  AMSAA then incorporated one of the algorithms into Fbar for customer use in Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) studies.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,False

We can illuminate the impact of installation services on readiness by careful examination of the historic prioritization of funding for installations and potentially highlight critical HQDA validated requirements related to installation services that may be underfunded.
The Principle Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy & Environment (DASA-IE&E) has expressed a commitment to ensure that installations provide the best services possible to support unit readiness.  An analytical overview of the direct and indirect linkages between installation and service programs to unit readiness will help show the potential impact of funding below requirements levels.  Analytical efforts include: Determining installation and service program linkages to unit readiness; develop a proposed prioritization matrix to help articulate the direct and indirect support to unit readiness; analysis of the Installation Program Evaluation Group (II PEG) service funding; comparison of funding levels to requirements in the past and the future to assess short- and long-term impact of deferred funding on Army readiness.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,False

To adequately assess whether a systems reliability requirement has been demonstrated with statistical confidence using classical methods, OT typically requires multiple test units to be operated for relatively long durations.  For programs with high reliability requirements, costly test units, or various resource and schedule constraints, a sufficient amount of testing is often infeasible.  In cases where OT provides limited test data, there can be large uncertainty associated with the reliability estimates for those particular units.  As a result, the Army increases the risk of fielding systems that may perform below expectations, which can negatively impact mission success and increase operating and support costs.
To address this issue, methodology was developed to provide improved reliability assessments under constrained environments.  The methodology utilizes an approximately non-informative Bayesian technique that allows reliability to be assessed by appropriately combining data across similar systems while taking into account the degree of commonality among the systems.  Applying this methodology can provide significant reductions in the uncertainty of reliability estimates for systems with limited OT data and for cases where OT data for individual test units cannot be combined due to variations between units and/or test conditions.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,False

An increasing number of military equipment have mobile applications that require that power be provided internal to the system (i.e. not be connected to a grid).  A number of different solutions are commercially available for these mobile power sources including batteries, fuel cells, internal combustion engines, photovoltaics, thermoelectric generators, gas turbines, and hybrid combinations of those technologies.  Market research was conducted to determine the relationship between power draw, mission duration, and mass for each of these technologies.  A tradeoff analysis was performed to determine the optimal system in regards to mass over a range of power draws and mission durations.  Shorter mission durations and low power requirements allow for a simple battery option.  Longer hour missions with low power requirements can use a hybrid system or a fuel cell; higher power draws necessitate an internal combustion engine or gas turbine.  Very long, multi-day missions can use photovoltaics and radioisotope thermoelectric generators.  This analysis was performed for available power solutions as well as those that are under development.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,True

networks and their topologies. This paper evaluates, via simulations, various attacker and defender
strategies within a dynamic game on network topology. The simulation is designed to provide insight into
the eectiveness of oensive targeting strategies as determined by various centrality measures, given limited
states of information and varying network topologies. Improved modeling of complex social behaviors
is accomplished through incorporation of a distance-based utility function. Moreover, insights into eective
defensive strategies are gained through incorporation of a hybrid model of network regeneration. Two
designed experiments investigate the impact of game features on the superlative oensive and defensive
strategies. Results indicate degree centrality, proximal target centrality, and closeness centrality outperform
other measures as targeting criteria given varying network topologies and defensive regeneration methods.
Furthermore, the attacker state of information is only signicant given a topology conducive to defense.
The costs of direct relationships signicantly impact eective regeneration methods, whereas restructuring
methods are insignicant. These results oer preliminary insight into practical attack and defense strategies

OTHRs achieve these long distances by using HF energy that refracts in the ionosphere. As a result, an OTHR's performance depends on the time of day and season. OTHRs use Doppler processing to distinguish fast targets from reflections from the ocean, but because ocean waves move at the same speed as ships, OTHRs must use special processing to detect ships. As a result, an OTHR's performance in detecting ships depends heavily on environmental conditions.
Determining this dependence, and how well an OTHR functions in general, can be expensive. A single measurement to test whether a ship can be detected would require a substantial amount of time.  A thorough test would require hundreds of iterations for time, sea state, etc., and thus hundreds of hours.
We devised a simpler means to conduct such a test. Many organizations track merchants via the Automatic Identification System, so we used these data to identify ships to serve as targets in our test. We  selected those merchants that met specific requirements, and presented their positions to the Navy's OTHRs to attempt detection. Repeating this for several weeks over two seasons, we collected viable data on 302 detection opportunities. We then compared the resulting detection rates for different conditions, allowing us to assess the OTHR's performance as a function of the time of day, season, course/speed, and sea state.",SECRET//REL TO FVEY,Distribution Statement B,False

This work resulted in a new set of 319 codes, comprising 282 single-injury ICD-9 codes and 37 multiple-injury-wound codes. NHRC analysts undertook a year-long effort to update the Medical Planners Toolkit (MPTk), a suite of casualty modeling and simulation tools, to accommodate the new ICD-9 set. 

The focus of the presentation will be on the data analysis effort that implemented the NHRC-derived set of 319 ICD-9 codes in MPTk and the effect this data change has in the development of hospital requirements. Various scenarios using patient condition occurrence frequency (PCOF) data of differing surgical intensities were run through the Expeditionary Medical Requirements Estimator (EMRE), a component tool of MPTk, to determine the change in theater hospital requirements (e.g., ICU beds, operating tables) as a result of implementing the new ICD-9 set. Since the NHRC-derived ICD-9 set accurately characterizes a much larger percentage of the combat data than the previous set, these requirements estimates will represent a significant improvement over those generated previously.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,False

This discussion will show how the helicopter routing problem can be modeled as a service network design problem with time windows.

Abstract 
As advances in the sophistication of aerial stealth technology increasingly thwarts friendly radar detection, the challenge becomes to innovate a complementary technology that detects and tracks stealth aircraft, without being similarly ineffective itself. This paper develops a general framework via modeling and simulation for estimating an adversary aircrafts atmospheric turbulence using a unified suite of optimization algorithms integrated into a simulated multi-mode Hyperspectral Coherent Doppler LIDAR (light radar). In turn this new radars processing can serve as a beneficial adjunct to traditional radar information processing of stealthy aircrafts radar-cross-section-area. This paper also addresses a sensitivity analysis of phase/systematic/statistical calibration errors impact on the simulated multimode Coherent Doppler LIDAR system.

As a proof of concept, TRAC focused on the AP Portfolio. The approach selected utilized a combination of facilitated problem-solving steps and decision-making tools from organizational effectiveness, operations research, and design for Six Sigma. The process included a call for nominations, a survey of stakeholders, and 2 workshops. A survey elicited potential objectives, factors, and criteria for the portfolio. The study team facilitated a panel of program owners and subject matter experts in finalizing portfolio objectives, identifying factors through root cause analysis, and developing and weighting portfolio criteria using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. At the second workshop, the panel applied the weighted criteria to each program using the Quality Function Deployment tool. Completion yielded prioritization scores for each program.

Achieving and maintaining readiness requires training.  Maintaining a properly trained force will become increasingly more difficult as the Armys budget decreases in the coming years.  One potential solution to this problem is to use the Mission Training Complex (MTC) facilities as a cheaper alternative to live training.  A MTC provides the capability to sustain Soldier individual digital skills, unit Mission Command (MC) collective training, and warfighting functional competencies using live-virtual-constructive gaming enablers.  The efficient use of these facilities to integrate live and simulation-based training will assist the Army in maintaining its desired level of readiness under the shadow of diminishing training dollars.
  It is unclear whether or not the Armys investment in MTCs is being utilized to its full capacity given that a set of standardized metrics to measure MTC capacity does not exist.  In an effort to ensure these resources are being utilized to their full capacity the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army (VCSA) has requested that the Center for Army Analysis (CAA), in coordination with G-3/5/7, develop a way to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the Armys MTC investment.

It is necessary to understand both how demography will influence Russia's ability to generate military power and how demographic factors could serve as catalysts for conflict around Russia's geographic periphery.
  This briefing will use a conceptual framework for assessing demographic factors that has been used in several past RAND studies.  After presenting the basic quantitative data on Russian demography, the briefing will reveal how demographic factors are influencing:  1) the nature of the conflicts that Russia is involved in, 2) the sources of Russian military power, and 3) the sources of armed conflict around Russia's periphery, from the Baltics through the Black Sea region and Central Asia, and all the way into the Russian Far East.

In 2013, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) commissioned the Maintenance Productivity Review, which determined that the average availability of an RAAF maintainer to perform maintenance is around 40%.  This drives the number of personnel required to support operations which in turn, increases O&S costs. This is significant as the maintenance manpower costs to operate USAF tactical aircraft is between 16% and 28% of the annual O&S cost.

Selected Army airborne forces provide a large portion of the GRF, and are dependent on joint concepts for deployment and access. This study illustrates a method for determining the best access strategies given constraints in aircraft, intermediate staging bases, operational capabilities, and other factors. The study applies this method to each geographic combatant command and develops specific, tailored strategies for each. 

The access strategies are built from multiple analytic techniques: historical aircraft data and platform specifications to determine capabilities and limitations of the air fleet; several airfield databases, site reports, and expert judgments to determine probable intermediate staging base locations and their likely capabilities; multiple deployment concepts for access to minimize operational risks; and, detailed geographic and operational analysis to determine global coverage and reach. In the end, we were able to deduce a preferred strategy for each of the combatant commands.  

Global access for the GRF is provided partially through the use of well-established staging bases, but will necessarily rely on austere basing and complex deployment concepts for particular locations in multiple combatant commands.  The study concludes with recommendations to close those risks, which span the services, combatant commands, and joint staff.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,False

The TRADOC Analysis Center (TRAC) established a study team to examine the alternatives that could mitigate the capability gap resulting from the Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) lack of sufficient enhanced tactical mobility to rapidly transport and maneuver forces across extended distances as part of a Joint Forcible Entry team in all environmental conditions.
The GMV AoA Study Directive identified two study issues for the AoA to address.  The AoA will (1) assess the cost, schedule, and performance risks for each alternative considering life-cycle cost, weight, and size of a vehicle and (2) assess IBCT operational effectiveness for each alternative considering maneuverability, fixed-wing employment, and rotary-wing employment.
This presentation will discuss how the study team assessed operational effectiveness of the GMV alternatives by focusing on the transportability and maneuverability of the alternatives within two scenario vignettes, both involving offset drop zone/landing zones.

Physical density of water, large geographic distances, and relatively low energy density power sources combine to make sensor coverage and transport, information logistics, and sustained presence non-trivial technical and operational problems. A multi-disciplinary optimization analysis of undersea networked operations (UNO) was conducted. The operational concept used a system of large modular unmanned undersea vehicles (LMUUV) and small UUVs (SUUV). Analysis was informed by wargame which examined an Anti-Access/Area Denial scenario to address issues of energy sustainment and information logistics, two of the most significant technical hurdles with operational impact.  The wargame highlighted the challenges of large area search and clearance, focusing quantitative analysis on these issues. Models were created to examine deployment, search, and sustainment (energy load and consumption) of the XLUUV-SUUV system and then a multi-dimensional optimization analysis was performed. Analysis included a full factorial comparison of operational variables for a LMUUV- SUUV system employed to clear a 1M km2 ocean area. A Pareto sort was performed to identify optimal combinations of operational variables relevant to UUV design and technology choices. Key enablers and areas that warrant further study were identified.

Mr. James Way

AMSAA calculates Probability of Incapacitation (P(I)) estimates for fragmenting munitions that are used in combat simulations throughout the Army and Marine Corps.  For direct-fire fragmenting munitions, AMSAA calculates a P(I) estimate for many combinations of posture, clothing/armor/helmet, casualty criterion, firer-to-target range, burst height, burst-to-target azimuth angle, and burst-to-target range.  Even for a modest number of munitions (11), the amount of data can be overwhelming (76 million P(I) estimates).  By training neural networks to learn the P(I) values, AMSAA has developed a scheme to compress the data by a factor of one thousand or more with no significant loss in accuracy.  Smaller data sets could ease some of the burden of data management on AMSAAs data customers, as well as take up less memory in their simulations.

Neural networks  and other machine learning algorithms such as genetic algorithms and classification trees  have been used by the Army in many applications besides compression, including predicting the terminal ballistics of kinetic energy projectiles, searching for optimal vehicle configurations, designing new fragmenting warheads, detecting data outliers, and predicting risk.

These enhancements improve the robustness of the resulting schedules and reduce the probability of cascading delays resulting from unanticipated service disruptions. The techniques explored include inserting operational slack into the schedule and reducing effective network sizes through isolation prior to applying mathematical optimization. Schedules with and without the robustness were compared through a simulation model that simulated stochastic real-world delays. It was found that the schedules with robustness included had enough resiliency to respond favorably to disruptions and outperformed the schedules that did not contain the new robustness features.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,False

A new modeling framework and algorithms are presented that expand upon the Air Forces legacy air vehicle attrition modeling capability, providing higher fidelity insights for force structure comparisons, and significantly reducing computational burden.   The process leverages the Advanced Framework for Simulation, Integration, and Modeling (AFSIM) in order to generate multi-directional attrition grids for an area of interest and aircraft package parameters.

Current budgetary constraints and an uncertain global security environment require these operations to be executed efficiently. Base camps are the secured areas where soldiers live when deployed to contingency operations. Base camps impose a significant financial and tactical burden during contingency operations and ineffective soldier quality of life decisions have contributed to costs. Quality of life (QOL) refers to the non-security and non-mission related services that directly sustain soldier mission effectiveness. Current US Army base camp tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are insufficient, and detailed doctrine should be developed to support combat units executing contingency operations. We employ quantitative methods to select decisions that improve QOL on base camps to inform doctrine. We use a QOL function and resource consumption data developed by US Army Natick Labs to build a model that improves QOL under the constraints of four resources: fuel, water, waste water, and solid waste. We employ a mixed integer linear program modeling approach and sensitivity analysis to evaluate the strength of our results.

Aircraft maintenance groups can service a limited number of aircraft in phase at one time, requiring effective management of their flying hour program (FHP) to preserve fleet readiness. Projecting aircraft sortie allocation accurately is crucial to administering this program. We examine long-range planning factors used by a Combat Air Forces Fighter Wing to project phase flow for its fighter aircraft by comparing projected sorties to actual sorties flown by individual aircraft on a daily basis. Employing linear regression and classification trees, we identify two statistically significant planning factors not previously accounted for: max gos (a measure of total daily activity) and seasonality. Supplementing current procedures with these new planning factors decreases projection error by 53% while generating conservative, defendable forecasts. We also suggest a modified phase curve that provides robustness against unforeseeable, yet reoccurring maintenance issues. Finally, we discuss how these updated planning factors can be incorporated into currently used planning tools.

By 2014, the rifle squad is carrying a large suite of electronics including the Nett Warrior system, thermal weapon sights, and counter-IED equipment.  Though necessary, these pieces of equipment significantly increased the operational energy requirement for the dismounted rifle squad.  The power and energy requirements for equipment loads from 1991, 2003, 2012, and 2014 were determined for a doctrinal 72-hour movement-to-contact mission.  The analysis found that these new capabilities resulted in an increase in energy consumption for the Squad from 530 WHr to 6390 WHr between 1991 and 2014, corresponding to an increase in battery weight from 12 lb to 117 lb.  The analysis then addresses methods to reduce the battery weight to include the following: decreasing the power draw from the equipment, increasing the energy density of batteries, deploying solar blankets, and using fuel cells.

The number of tests to be done typically is fixed in advance of the start of testing. This is a flawed test methodology. Test conduct should depend on the outcome of testing to date. If one is confident of the outcome (pass or fail), one should be prepared to quit early. If the outcome is ambiguous, then and only then should testing continue.
The testing approach discussed here adopts a Bayesian formalism and fixes, not the number of tests, but the expected number of tests to be done. In the limit that one expects to do several tens of tests, the optimal stopping strategy to minimize probability of pass/fail decision error is well modeled using a diffusive stochastic process. The stopping strategy in this limiting situation is simply expressed as a dimensionless positive real valued function of a single dimensionless positive real variable.
Doing enough sequences of tests that expected numbers of tests become numbers of tests, an improvement in testing strategy can be wrought. For fixed number of tests, probability of decision error is decreased. Fixing probability of decision error, the number of tests required is decreased. The decreases can be dramatic. Though the diffusive strategy function is a limiting case approximation, a Monte Carlo simulation shows how effective the scheme can be. This approach is effective in many testing situations.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,True

The warfighter would like to know if it is feasible that the UCT is the lost object. To accomplish this, we are developing UCT-LO Comparison Enabling Reacquisition (ULCER), which not only determines feasibility but also provides a ranking schema among potential UCTs. A component of this is obtaining the globally optimal energy requirements to complete the requisite transfer under constrained time and with consideration for non-impulse maneuvers. We accomplish this by analyzing its orbital properties and predictions of its maneuver capabilities, and tested this algorithm through simulations developed using random perturbations of real satellite two-line elements (TLEs).

Each CAB estimates whether it needs supplemental contractor support using its own unique heuristic or rule of thumb calculations since a standardized approach to quantify this Maintenance Man-Hour (MMH) gap has never been implemented.  
This paper describes how U.S. Army Program Executive Office (PEO) Aviation subject matter experts, working with a Booz Allen Hamilton (Booz Allen) team, developed and validated a model that can quantify the MMH gap using a consistent and defendable methodology.  
After using the model to analyze several scenarios, the paper concludes: (1) the MMH gap exists under all by ideal doctrinal conditions, (2) the Army Restructuring Initiative proposal to add 45 maintainers to each CAB will not eliminate the MMH gap, (3) in the near term, the most feasible alternative is to continue to plan for, budget, and use contractor support, and (4) each CAB and the Army would benefit from using a standard MMH model to quantify the gap.

These improvements can be offset by the cost to stand up a cluster or distributed bases that are generally more vulnerable to airbase attack. Research questions have been structured to address these issues and follow-on activities have been formulated.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement D,False

There are a number of reasons for this deficiency: security, lack of data, legacy models that do not provide hooks for cyber implementation and data extraction, and a general shortage of information about cyber effects.  When cyber-effects are examined in budget drills, analysts cannot provide decision makers with information about the cost-benefit of cyber investments because they are not played in the same environment used to assess cost-benefit of kinetic systems.  Recently the Mission Analyses Division of Air Force Studies, Analyses, and Assessments (AF/A9FM) adopted a new mission-level modeling environment, AFSIM, in which they began experimenting with cyber simulations.
This presentation provides an overview of cyber effects modeling at the mission level using the AFSIM simulation environment.  First, we build a framework for creating cyber effects using AFSIM core elements.  Next, we identify desirable cyber effects from the perspective of military task accomplishment and implement them using the developed framework.  Finally, we create a simple mission-level simulation, with and without cyber effects, to illustrate how such effects might affect mission outcomes.

Most recently, adversaries have incorporated commercially available unmanned aerial systems (UAS) into their toolbox, necessitating an evaluation of risk to critical infrastructure. The study authors developed a scenario-based approach for conducting the assessment that accounted for the capabilities of UAS, a range of potential adversary intent, and incorporated existing vulnerability and consequence data.

These responses are part of the Biometrics End to End Process Simulation (BEEPS) designed by AMSAA.  In support of the Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), AMSAA developed the Arena based process model BEEPS.  BEEPS is an adaptive, single model built to represent five technical alternatives and two hosting options for the AoA. The model was constructed iteratively with the guidance of subject matter experts facilitating the validation of all process flows and data inputs prior to integration.  BEEPS accounts for network transit time and traffic and incorporates delays to and from theater via tactical and satellite networks. All manual and automated processes within the BEC are simulated in BEEPS.  For the manual BEC processes represented in BEEPS, utilization of human-in-the-loop resources is reported in order to calculate appropriate personnel levels.  Output statistics on biometric submission response times are categorized by classification, modality, priority, origin, and network.  BEEPS output was used to perform sensitivity analysis on loading, staffing, classification and the cross domain solution of the system, and differences among alternatives in the AoA.  BEEPS is an enduring and modifiable AMSAA tool for use in future biometrics studies and is the recipient of the 2015 AMSO M&S Analysis award.",UNCLASSIFIED WITH FOUO,Distribution Statement A,True

First, a short discussion of PMESII-DIME approached will be covered to provide a starting point for how the Department of Defense approaches Human Terrain.  Next, an overview of KAPSARCs  approach to study the interaction between human terrain and energy issues will be presented, with a summary of the human terrain studies in China, East Africa, and India.  A description of KTAB will be presented, along with information on where members of the MORS community can access data and human terrain tools covered in this presentation.  Overall, this presentation is designed to provide information on a similar approach to studying Human Terrain and to profile key data sources open all of the community.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,True

This paper describes a data collection effort in Afghanistan where IED event data and dismounted friendly force patrol movements were obtained. The IED
event data is analyzed in time and space with
no clear resemblance to a Poisson process in
either domain. Consequently, a spatial clustering model is developed to model the
collected data with high fidelity and few input parameters.Next, an IED emplacement
model is developed to estimate emplacement
times based on the interaction between the
time and spatial dimensions of the friendly force data and the IED encounter data.
Finally, simulated data is used to test the
sensitivity of the model to a range of input
parameters. From this we suggest improvements to the fidelity of the input data for the most accurate output results.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,True

However, with surging demand for RPA combat operations, the United States Air Force (USAF) has struggled to train and retain sufficient manpower to operate these aircraft. Earlier efforts to address this challenge relied on military intuition and subjective input instead of objective analysis, engendering significant manpower shortfalls and jeopardizing USAF capacity to complete RPA missions worldwide.  As part of a recent effort by the Secretary of Defense to stabilize manpower trends in the USAF RPA enterprise, we developed a dynamic manpower projection model to quantify the potential impact of over fifty policy initiatives. Ultimately, the model illuminated that a combination of five major policy initiatives would most efficiently and expeditiously improve manpower trends. The Air Force has already begun to implement these initiatives as part of a plan that will affect over 1100 Active Duty airmen operating a multibillion-dollar enterprise.

He concludes that while CASO (Complex Adaptive Special Operations) produces  near autonomous action and is potentially at odds with hierarchically oriented commanders, it is potentially the only way a diffuse non-conventional rival will be defeated.  This presentation shows that the research topics for Special Operations identified by the Joint Special Operations University for 2016 includes many topics that could benefit from a complex adaptive systems approach to their analysis.

Data from Aircraft Monitor and Control (AMAC) is analyzed to identify trends which may indicate degradation of aircraft components resulting from age or modifications. Aircrafts produce electrical signals which must fall within the System 1 Specified limits in order to acquire and maintain nuclear certification. These signals have been collected several times per year since 2004, during certification and surveillance testing. The data is then grouped by a number of parameters and t-tests are conducted in order to identify possible dependencies and patterns. A separate analysis is done by using backward elimination method to find a subset of parameters that best explains the data. Using this subset, a linear regression model predicts AMAC values out to year 2030 based on a 90% confidence interval. Results of the analysis are used to determine the reliability of AMAC components over time, affecting the maintenance and longevity of the aircraft.",UNCLASSIFIED WITH FOUO,Distribution Statement B,False

The primary source of this data is simulation output generated by global climate models, which is at present at a much lower spatial resolution that that necessary for the assessment. Downscaling of the global climate model simulation results using statistical and dynamic downscaling is the preferred method for obtaining the data. While near-term (2-20 years) climate model projections are uncertain due to model internal variability, longer-term projections uncertainty is dominated by uncertainties in emission scenarios of GHGs.

8 interviews were conducted of operations and analytic personnel who interact with the system.

We integrate these insights into a coherent method for data quality in large, operational data stores, with a particular focus on the impact of human factors on introducing bias and error into the data, and techniques for mitigating these issues using a mixed-method approach that uses both qualitative and quantitative techniques to ensure reliable data.

Mr. James Way

AMSAA calculates Probability of Incapacitation (P(I)) estimates for fragmenting munitions that are used in combat simulations throughout the Army and Marine Corps.  For direct-fire fragmenting munitions, AMSAA calculates a P(I) estimate for many combinations of posture, clothing/armor/helmet, casualty criterion, firer-to-target range, burst height, burst-to-target azimuth angle, and burst-to-target range.  Even for a modest number of munitions (11), the amount of data can be overwhelming (76 million P(I) estimates).  By training neural networks to learn the P(I) values, AMSAA has developed a scheme to compress the data by a factor of one thousand or more with no significant loss in accuracy.  Smaller data sets could ease some of the burden of data management on AMSAAs data customers, as well as take up less memory in their simulations.

Neural networks  and other machine learning algorithms such as genetic algorithms and classification trees  have been used by the Army in many applications besides compression, including predicting the terminal ballistics of kinetic energy projectiles, searching for optimal vehicle configurations, designing new fragmenting warheads, detecting data outliers, and predicting risk.

A MALS has a limited quantity of parts available to support multiple squadrons of aircraft which may be geographically distributed.  Inventories of repair parts may be carried at each node of the MALS logistics chain in order to avoid long delays in obtaining repair parts and therefore maximize readiness of the supported aircraft.  The topology of the logistics chain may contain intermediate sites, such as en-route support bases, which allow inventory to be stored closer to forward operating bases (FOBs) while maintaining smaller supply footprints at the FOBs.  The simulation presented herein utilizes historical data to model stochastic demands at each node of the logistics chain based upon the mixture of aircraft types located at each node.  An optimization routine is used to generate inventory placement strategies which meet the priorities of the logistics chain; these priorities are defined in terms of target fill-rates at each node.  The simulation concurrently estimates the performance of each inventory placement strategy which is generated by the optimization routine.

A discrete-event simulation model has been developed that represents individual aircraft moving between various states, such as between ashore and embarked, and between serviceable (able to fly) and all types of maintenance, including unscheduled maintenance.  The model incorporates various policies for the daily allocation of flying and maintenance resources, as well as rotating aircraft between squadrons and balancing the flying hours across the fleet.  The model also has a large number of input values, and while many are fixed, others are more ambiguous.  When these influences are combined, there is clearly a large variable space to be explored. 

Given this, a simulation experimental design approach has been applied to this problem.  This allows a thorough exploration of the variable space in fewer runs than is otherwise required.  We apply this design to the range of continuous and discrete variables and fleet management policies, where each policy may have between two and five values.

Conceptual design of the information fusion architectures enabling this capability involves the concurrent design of individual systems, communication topologies, information flow, and data fusion algorithms. As such, evaluation of alternatives is made challenging by the large and topologically complex nature of the resultant alternative space. A tool for analyzing such design spaces, imposing constraints, and finding efficient methods of encoding them for heuristic exploration of the alternative space is demonstrated. An overview of the current state of the art for non-simulation based information fusion performance prediction methods is given. This is contrasted with the computational feasibility of brute force Monte Carlo simulation-based analysis of performance. Finally, a method of relating stochastic information fusion measures of performance to system of system level measures of effectiveness is presented. Taken together, these techniques for the representation, exploration, analysis and valuation of the alternative space provide a framework to more accurately assess a broader array of information fusion architecture design alternatives in early design.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,True

Mr. Matt Rosenblatt & Mr. James Way

The Fbar (F?) model, developed by the U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA), is a Monte Carlo simulation for estimating the effectiveness of small arms weapons and munitions.  Fbar simulates a single direct-fire weapon firing at a passive area personnel target.  In each replication, Fbar considers aiming strategy, delivery accuracy, and vulnerability data to estimate the probability of incapacitating each of the targets in the area, and therefore the fraction F of the target that is incapacitated.  The principal model output is F?, the average of F over all replications.

As originally developed, Fbar could handle bullets and fragmenting munitions.  Fragmenting munitions could have a point-detonating fuze or an air-bursting fuze triggered by elapsed time or turns count.  In late 2014, the Armys Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of an air-bursting munition with a proximity fuze. In response, AMSAA developed two algorithms that calculate where a proximity fuze will function as the munition comes near to the ground, a target, or a protective wall.  AMSAA ran both algorithms for millions of conditions.  They agree to within 1/800th of a centimeter.  AMSAA then incorporated one of the algorithms into Fbar for customer use in Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) studies.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,False

However, acquisition resources fund the development of individual systems, not the aggregate systems of systems (SoS) of which they are a part. Assessments of SoS interoperability in air warfare, surface warfare, amphibious warfare, and other operational contexts have demonstrated that interoperability deficiencies impede the full realization of system capabilities. This paper gives examples of such interoperability assessment efforts conducted by multiple organizations over the course of the past three decades and of how assessment findings led to correction of interoperability issues that impeded system capabilities. Follow-through of assessment findings included repeated documentation of the issues to system program offices and/or the Joint Interface Configuration Control Board to spur correction of those issues. In some cases, specific programs corrected software deficiencies; in other cases, enterprise solutions were developed that were implemented by multiple system programs. The paper also discusses assessment findings that remain uncorrected and describes some ongoing efforts to address outstanding issues and to extend the scope of interoperability assessments to as yet unassessed operational contexts.",SECRET,Distribution Statement B,False

Tenth St,,Claremont,CA,91711,United States,,,16540,True,Recent scholarship on national power distribution models argues against realist theory claims that interactions among nations occur in anarchy & concludes this is oversimplified & inaccurate; nations interact with each other in different ways depending on the level of trust they have developed over repeated interactions (retrospective trust building).  Metrics reflecting satisfaction & trust (security cooperation) are not generally available & those in use fail to capture variations in these key elements.  Adding the notion of trust to any analysis more accurately shows the interactions & their outcomes. We define trust as acting as if the uncertain future action of others were indeed certain in circumstances wherein the violation of these expectations results in negative outcomes for those involved. Noting the absence of a Satisfaction measure that estimates trust we constructed a novel approach to this critical element.

The combination of minimal hardware requirements and rapid network configuration has reduced CDX planning time from months to days. This briefing describes how the VCR is now being used and outlines options for the future.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,False

The study team and subject matter experts examined trades among performance, schedule, and costs within the alternatives; detailed analysis by Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA) and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Cost and Economics (DASA-CE) supported the effort. 

This presentation will highlight the results of the study and describe how the LTAMDC trades analysis informed opportunities to improve performance of radar alternatives while maintaining affordability. Further, it will discuss the methodology of leveraging collaborative workshops to foster qualitative discussion and identification of unique solutions to difficult problems. The briefer will also address limitations, assumptions, various challenges, and lessons learned for this study.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,True

Insights into the emerging capabilities of advanced directed energy (DE) weapons and kinetic energy (such as DARPAs MAD-FIRES program) solutions show the promise of these new weapon systems in support of various applications.  This analysis examines how lower cost kinetic energy (KE or Gun) and DE solutions might be employed along with a Patriot battery to provide a point defense of Guam against large raids of closely-timed, fast maneuvering aerial targets.  The goal of the defense in this study is defeat of the raids with a reduced demand on the Patriot missile inventory, saving them for follow-on ballistic missile attacks, where the Patriot system is most necessary.

Where will the funds come from to pay for mitigation and response activities and 2.) What will be the impacts on the value of existing developments in threatened areas?  Both of these issues can have an impact from a National Security perspective.
In many areas of the developing world, countries are simply struggling to metaphorically keep their heads above water from a simple day-to-day survival perspective. Many of them barely have enough financial resources to meet their basic needs and clearly do not have the economic resources to develop climate impact mitigation and response strategies. Many of those countries are broadcasting to the world that they will need assistance from donor countries in order to develop and execute any climate impacts response strategies.

The NTC, which began training troops in 1981, was established with two central goals: to train the rotational unit and to provide lessons-learned to aid in training across the Army.  The NTC has been always focused primarily on the former, but has a rich history of efforts towards improving the latter using its instrumentation system (IS). Ultimately however, these efforts resulted in a LL system that lacks rigorous analysis of quantitative IS data across multiple rotations. I propose that such a system has faced three barriers throughout its history: lack of institutional commitment, poor data quality, and inadequate computing/analytical resources. Today, two of these problems have largely been resolved, and the third, institutional commitment, can be overcomethough not without careful considerations of cost and the complex institutional environment at the CTCs.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,False

Each of these actions required an appropriate manpower study, which included determining requirements for Support to Staff ratio, identifying underutilized positions, restructuring for efficiency, and applying a model for HELOS based on the MTF category.  To facilitate this analysis, multiple operations research techniques were applied, with the analysis encompassing (for any given location) many aspects to include but not limited to the number of beneficiaries, the number of providers, and the productivity of a given MTF.

Reconciliation of the ends-means-ways balance, dependent on socio-economics and politics, forms a constrained decision space with complex behavior.  As a result, planning is even more challenging due to the dynamically changing operating environment.  This strains the decision making process and the development of Courses of Action, COAs.  COA evaluations require wargaming outputs to be matched with multi-attribute decision making methods to arrive at an order.  However, time constraints limit the scope of decision space evaluation.  Even with the increased utilization of computer modeling and simulation, the COA analysis process prevents complete alternative enumeration.  The objective of this research is to develop a methodology which enables the identification of critical decision points through a sufficient search of the decision space.  Through experimentation, it will be shown that position, capability, and awareness metrics can be mined in simulation data via unsupervised learning to determine critical decision points.  These decision points encapsulate sets of candidate COA solutions.

It is worth noting that this program approach also misses Green rated programs that may overachieve objectives or have created unused capacity that increases costs. An alternative strategy for our customer, the Chief Financial Officer, leverages the Resource Consumption Accounting (RCA) framework of Enterprise Resource Planning systems recently implemented in the organization. The RCA framework enables the organization to understand marginal costs of achieving enterprise objectives, and helps isolate and measure unused capability costs. This methodology uses exploratory data analysis techniques to screen enterprise data for areas where resources may be under- or over-allocated, and may become the focus of future analysis using traditional correlation means.

Given the broad goals of such studies, researchers have yet to determine how and in what context economic interdependence is expected to influence various types of conflict occurring at various levels of intensity. Novel techniques such as random forests and decision trees allow a more precise determination of this relationship. These techniques demonstrate three key lessons for future researchers: first, the importance of economic interdependence varies across levels of conflict; second, economic indicators are more predictive of conflict in some historical periods than in others; and third, certain economic variables are particularly predictive of conflict between pairs in which at least one country is nuclear armed.

Through the course of this project, it has been determined that the implementation of TFP, transit speed caps, and use of optimal engine configurations will improve operational effectiveness by allowing additional hours on station and reduce the amount of time spent refueling. Ships can reduce their fuel consumption during transits by as much as 20% by using the TFP or a similar program such as OTTER. Alternatively, maximum speed constraints can be enforced to reduce fuel consumption, but are not as effective as the TFP. In some circumstances, Escorts using optimal engine configurations instead of running full plant during CSG operations can extend the duration of their operations by more than 50%. This was determined by modeling a wide variety of transits and CSG operations within the Fuel Usage Study Extended Demonstration (FUSED) model developed at the Naval Postgraduate School.

Since conflict is between groups of people, it follows that conflict is most likely to occur where people are: the urban environment. Thus, this is where militaries will be most likely to operate. 

Despite the many challenges in terms of access, mobility, battlespace geometry and the like, the truly unique aspect of the urban environment is the presence of a dense, interconnected, population. While a given military mission might not be for the people, conduct of an urban operation will certainly be amongst the people, making the population a critical operational variable regardless of the populaces sympathies.

While approaches vary based upon the duration of staleness, methods for locating an LO under multiple maneuvers are scarce, rely on a disorderly set of uncorrelated tracks (UCTs) for comparison, and are subject to narrow search windows or long processing times.  Our approach, UCT-LO Comparison Enabling Reacquisition (ULCER), focuses on orbital parameters and timing components in order to account for up to four undetected maneuvers resulting in a rapid orbital transfer.  ULCER utilizes a combination of exclusion criterion and probabilistic maneuver convolutions while accounting for gradual acceleration.

Operational test (OT) runs the gamut between tests for highly complex systems in complex battlespaces to tests for simple systems in highly controlled, laboratory-like environments. If ? represent the combined battlespace realism/complexity of a system under test (SUT) with 0 representing little operational realism/little system complexity and 1 representing Air Force Red Flag realism for highly complex systems, operational test design (TD) methodology should combine DOE-based test design methods with Red Flag-like test methods according to

TD=??Flag+(1-?)?DOE

DOE-based test design methods seek to increase the detectability of main effects and interactions through tightly controlled test designs with orthogonalized battlespace sampling plans. They are ideal when ? is at or near 0. When ? is at or near 1, there is little (if any) orthogonalized sampling of the battlespace. On the spot operators run the test as they see fit given what they know. It follows, then, that if A represents post hoc data analysis methods, it should also be conducted according to A=??Flag+(1-?)?DOE.  For ?>0, post hoc test data analysis should include clustering, regression, or other applicable entropy reducing machine learning (ML) and machine cognitive methods. This early stage work will expand on these concepts and introduce complementary phase space language to enable better understanding of the dynamics of a system under test (SUT) in its intended battlespace.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,True

Although annual personnel cost estimates exist in AFI 65-503, the Air Reserve Components estimates do not have the same fidelity as the Regular AF. For example, it estimates AF Reserve Composite Pay Factors by category of employment but does not distinguish costs by grade or cost element. In addition, the table does not account for the utilization of part-time reservists, which are the majority of members for the reserve components. Annual cost estimates for part-time reservists are difficult to determine because these estimates depend on the type and amount of utilization. HQ AFRC/A9, working with SAF/FMCE and AF/A9R, developed annual cost estimates for traditional reservists and individual mobilization augmentees which include these additional details; the costs were developed using the Individual Cost Assessment Model (ICAM). ICAM is a simulation that models individual Airmen through hypothetical careers and estimates annual and life cycle manpower costs. The updated tables for AFI 65-503 quantifies annual costs as utilization increases. The utilization can be in the form of short-term requirements, such as additional training periods, readiness management periods, or reserve personnel appropriations. It also includes long-term orders (more than 31 days) which gives the member additional benefits.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,False

COSAGE requires both equipment characteristic and weapon effectiveness input data to produce combat samples for theater-level models. These input data are produced by a well-established process for all currently modeled defense scenarios.

OPRAL is an analytical model for determining the optimal repair locations, manpower and support equipment levels and spares allocations in a multi-level hierarchical support organization. The model is based on the spares optimization model OPUS10. In OPUS10 the analyst can either treat repair decisions as fixed and given as input parameters, or using the OPRAL algorithm, evaluate several different repair strategies in order to find the optimal one. The dependence between repair and spares allocation decisions is strong, which why it is necessary to integrate the optimization of the two.

2.)	The problem of determining the optimum repair strategy is sometimes called location-of-repair analysis or LORA while OPRAL is an analytical model for determining the optimal repair locations and spares allocations in a multi-level hierarchical support organization based on the spares optimization model OPUS10. OPRAL optimization technique is based around the powerful concept of convexification.

After presenting the basic quantitative data on Russian demography, the briefing will reveal how demographic factors are influencing:  1) the nature of the conflicts that Russia is involved in, 2) the sources of Russian military power, and 3) the sources of armed conflict around Russia's periphery, from the Baltics through the Black Sea region and Central Asia, and all the way into the Russian Far East.

For chemical hazards this involves using toxicology information, scenario specific exposure parameters and data linking specific health effects to operational impacts.  We present an overall framework that makes the connection between available toxicity data and operational effects by utilizing exposure and operational assessment methodologies.  We show that the exposure assessment has a large impact on operational risk for inhalation exposures and is the driver of risk for contact or dermal exposure scenarios.  Details on scenario specific exposures and operational requirements are assembled from existing doctrine and based on subject matter expert input.  This cumulates in an overall assessment methodology that may be used to assess existing or proposed material or equipment capabilities based on the specific mission set identified for those materials or equipment.

Failing to do so increases operational risk. It also makes it difficult to test, replicate, compare it to other iterations or analyses, and to analyze and interpret results.

Each classifier in the ensemble is induced on a different binomial target vector, generated by indicator functions spaced throughout the expected range of the response variable. The predicted probabilities of class membership generated by the trained models on test data are aggregated to estimate a unique cumulative distribution function for the response value of each instance. In addition to the distributions generated by the ensemble, I discuss two ways of generating a point estimate. The first is by calculating the expected value of the smoothed probability distribution function for each instance through local polynomial regression fitting. The second method uses the concept of stacked generalization to train a new meta-algorithm, conducting a regression analysis using the probability outputs of the ensemble constituents as training features. The methodology outlined in this research provides more information to decision makers regarding the certainty and distribution of their predictions.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,True

As such, critical infrastructure are the target of adversaries intent on causing harm to the social, economic, and national security of our country. Critical infrastructure protection programs date back nearly two decades to Presidential Decision Directive-63 which identified protection of critical infrastructure as a priority of the Federal Government. During that time the nature and scope of threats to critical infrastructure has evolved, as have the definitions of what constitutes critical infrastructure. As new threats emerge methodologies must be developed in order to characterize and assess the risk to critical infrastructure. Most recently, adversaries have incorporated commercially available unmanned aerial systems (UAS) into their toolbox, necessitating an evaluation of risk to critical infrastructure.

However, defense of those bases from a raid of cruise missiles presents significant concerns. This presentation summarizes a study performed by JHU/APL to evaluate mission performance versus cost against a large raid of cruise missile threats to a forward base. The study is part of the Quick Reaction Analysis Team (QRAT) under OSD AT&L.
The objective is to assess sensitivity trade-offs for various cruise missile defense options, including the benefits provided by Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS). Other options include F-15C, PATRIOT, and Aegis DDG as well as integrated fire control between mixes of platforms. Our approach, driven by scope and time constraints of the study, uses spreadsheet modeling of the kill chain informed by results from previous higher fidelity analyses to quickly evaluate mission performance versus cost across a large matrix of options (over 7000 cases).
This study determined many options available provide good performance, but the key differentiator is cost. Multiple DDGs provide the best mission performance versus cost. However, that may be impractical due to limited number of platforms. Therefore, a mix of platforms, including JLENS is recommended as the best solution to provide layered defense. Study results were well received by OSD and COCOM with intentions to explore implications of forward stationing JLENS to support forward base defense.",SECRET,Distribution Statement D,False

However, as U.S. national security policy focuses on ensuring U.S. presence in the Pacific region, the Air Force must be prepared to deploy and operate its forces in environments where air bases could be subject to anti-access/area-denial (A2AD) attacks. As an adversary attempts to limit the generation of Air Force combat power through the use of explosive ordnance, casualty streams are likely to be significant at bases across the theater of operations. 

The current expeditionary medical support system has been optimized, and works very well, for conflicts that resemble those in recent history but may be challenged given the differences of an A2AD conflict including higher numbers of casualties, the inability to evacuate injured personnel, and the inability to resupply medical treatment facilities. 

RAND is developing a framework for evaluating planned expeditionary medical support and using it to identify potential investments to improve medical outcomes.

High-TRL surveillance systems with fielded prototypes, which could support a 2030 emplacement, were examined to quantify their effectiveness in enabling appropriate NORAD response mechanisms against unknown and potentially hostile aircraft.  Metrics were designed to provide insight into the role of initial warning time on the success of NORAD response elements.  
The region of surveillance analyzed is defined by the boundaries of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program (AMAP).   Coverage of the region was computed for existing baseline sensors, and then compared to improvements gained under four additional surveillance architectures.  Detection and tracking metrics were defined to assess the architectures performance versus baseline, against aircraft routes originating in, or transiting through, the AMAP region.

Given this environment of limited data and substantial uncertainty associated with predicting the future, for best decision support the DoD has quantified the confidence (i.e., uncertainty) of the estimate using stochastic modeling.

Conceptual design of IF architectures involves the concurrent design of individual systems, communication topologies, information flow, and fusion algorithms. The large, topologically complex resulting alternative space makes evaluation of alternatives computationally challenging. Additionally, the stochastic nature of sensor measurements typically necessitates a Monte Carlo approach to determining information fusion performance. Thus, even with advances in distributed high performance computing, full-factorial design space exploration of information fusion architectures with high-fidelity modeling and simulation is infeasible. Three approaches to IF performance analysis attempt to bridge this gap: extensions to Posterior Cramer-Rao Bounds which provide theoretical best-case performance limits; analytical approaches which model performance as a function of a few parameters; and lastly, more complex deterministic algorithmic approaches. Coupled with heuristic, genetic algorithm-based design space exploration, each method offers means to more accurately assess a broader array of IF architecture alternatives.

To adequately assess whether a systems reliability requirement has been demonstrated with statistical confidence using classical methods, OT typically requires multiple test units to be operated for relatively long durations.  For programs with high reliability requirements, costly test units, or various resource and schedule constraints, a sufficient amount of testing is often infeasible.  In cases where OT provides limited test data, there can be large uncertainty associated with the reliability estimates for those particular units.  As a result, the Army increases the risk of fielding systems that may perform below expectations, which can negatively impact mission success and increase operating and support costs.
To address this issue, methodology was developed to provide improved reliability assessments under constrained environments.  The methodology utilizes an approximately non-informative Bayesian technique that allows reliability to be assessed by appropriately combining data across similar systems while taking into account the degree of commonality among the systems.  Applying this methodology can provide significant reductions in the uncertainty of reliability estimates for systems with limited OT data and for cases where OT data for individual test units cannot be combined due to variations between units and/or test conditions.",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,False

Another simulation provides a fast-running tool to perform analyses on the sortie generation potential of air bases before and after attack. As part of a holistic look at base-level operational energy, this simulation focuses on logistical, personnel, and equipment requirements to support sortie generation. A third simulation under consideration would address the ability to deliver operational energy assets to austere bases.
These simulations are anticipated to be useful to inform Senior Leaders and serve as an input for campaign analytic and enterprise-level tools. This presentation will discuss the toolkit - the Airbase Damage Assessment and Resiliency Model (AD-ARM) - as well as the individual simulations",UNCLASSIFIED NO FOUO,Distribution Statement A,False

As the Army draws down to the lowest end strength since 1940, it is critical that the right individuals are placed in the right assignments.  Promotion boards are the largest lever currently used in the Army Competitive Category (ACC) to identify and reward talent.  However, the current promotion system is not aligned with Army requirements at the Army Occupational Specialty (AOC) level.  ACC officers compete within three competitive categories, Operations Division, Operations Support Division, and Force Sustainment Division.  Historical continuation rates are used to identify the annual steady state number of officers that are needed to promote by grade to fill future requirements.  The aggregate number is then distributed among the three competitive categories so that each division promotes at a similar opportunity rate.  This briefing explores an alternative promotion model that more closely aligns with future requirements in order to gain insights into an innovative solution to talent management.  This alternative identifies the number of officers to promote by grade and by specialty and how it contrasts with result from a recent promotion board.

Although annual personnel cost estimates exist in AFI 65-503, the Air Reserve Components estimates do not have the same fidelity as the Regular AF. For example, it estimates AF Reserve Composite Pay Factors by category of employment but does not distinguish costs by grade or cost element. In addition, the table does not account for the utilization of part-time reservists, which are the majority of members for the reserve components. Annual cost estimates for part-time reservists are difficult to determine because these estimates depend on the type and amount of utilization. HQ AFRC/A9, working with SAF/FMCE and AF/A9R, developed annual cost estimates for traditional reservists and individual mobilization augmentees which include these additional details; the costs were developed using the Individual Cost Assessment Model (ICAM). ICAM is a simulation that models individual Airmen through hypothetical careers and estimates annual and life cycle manpower costs. The updated tables for AFI 65-503 quantifies annual costs as utilization increases. The utilization can be in the form of short-term requirements, such as additional training periods, readiness management periods, or reserve personnel appropriations.
